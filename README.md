### README is generated by Copilot 

The **Tour Gallery App** is a React-based application that displays a list of tours fetched from an external API. Users can explore various tours, read more about them, and remove tours they are not interested in. If all tours are removed, a "Refresh" button allows users to reload the data.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tour List**: Fetches tour data from an external API and displays it in a responsive gallery layout.
- **Tour Details**: Each tour includes a name, price, description, and image.
- **Read More/Show Less**: Toggle to expand or collapse the tour description.
- **Remove Tour**: Users can remove tours they are not interested in.
- **Refresh Tours**: Reload the list of tours when none are left.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS-in-JS**: Inline styles for component-specific styling.
- **Fetch API**: For retrieving data from the external API.
